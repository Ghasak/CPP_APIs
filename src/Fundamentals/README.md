# C++ Fundamentals


## Introduction:
You have a project consists of several C++ files
And there are two types of compilations
- Compile the C++ individually into objective file (F7 in Microsoft Visual studio)
- Build the entire project where both the compiling into objective file and linking will happen (F5 in Microsoft Visual studio)

Thatâ€™s why we have two types of errors
Cxxxxx ==> compilation errors
LINKxxxx ==> linking errors.

Once you compile a C++ individual file, you request a specific function or
class a promise that the function is declared somewhere (usually in header
files).

But no linking ever will happen until you build the entire project
Also, there are two types of building project
- Static Linking
- Dynamic Linking

## CPP  in Nutshell
- Source code
- Preprocessor
- Modified Source Code
- Compiler
- Object Code
- Linker
- Executable Code


## Variables in C++
We use data and manipulate data and modify we need to store the data in variables.
But we care only of the variables of C++ as the size is the only matter.
data will be stored in memory either in
- Stack  or
- Heap
We have a primitive data type. The primitive data different distiguation of the primitive data type is only the size.

### Integer
- int : 4 bytes //-2billions -> 2 billions
-


## Functions in C++

- Write the return type of the function
- Give a function a name
- Set the parameters with their types

```cpp



```
