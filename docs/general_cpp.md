# General concepts in CPP

There are several programming paradigms beyond procedural, imperative, and
expression-oriented programming. I'll expand the table to include a broader
range of these paradigms, along with examples of programming languages that
exemplify each:

| Programming Paradigm          | Description                                                                | Examples of Languages           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Procedural                    | Focuses on procedure calls; structured into functions or routines.         | C, Pascal, Fortran              |
| Imperative                    | Centers on changing program state through statements.                      | Java, Python, C++               |
| Object-Oriented               | Based on the concept of "objects" which are data structures.               | Java, C++, Python               |
| Functional                    | Emphasizes the application of functions.                                   | Haskell, Lisp, Erlang           |
| Logic                         | Based on formal logic, primarily used for problem solving.                 | Prolog, Datalog                 |
| Declarative                   | Expresses the logic without describing its control flow.                   | SQL, HTML, Prolog               |
| Event-Driven                  | Focuses on the flow of the program driven by events like user actions.     | JavaScript, C#                  |
| Concurrent                    | Allows multiple computations to run simultaneously.                        | Go, Erlang, Java                |
| Distributed                   | Runs across multiple computer systems and communicates through network.    | Elixir, Scala, Akka             |
| Aspect-Oriented               | Focuses on separating cross-cutting concerns from the main program logic.  | AspectJ, Spring AOP             |
| Reflective                    | Ability of a program to manipulate the structure and behavior of the code. | Java, Python, Ruby              |
| Constraint-Based/Logic        | Solves problems by setting constraints and solving them.                   | Prolog, MiniZinc                |
| Parallel                      | Parallel execution of computations, often for performance in high load.    | CUDA, OpenMP, MPI               |
| Expression-Oriented           | Emphasizes expressions that return values over statements.                 | OCaml, Lisp, Haskell            |
| Query-Driven/Database-Centric | Paradigm revolving around database queries.                                | SQL, LINQ                       |
| Symbolic                      | Focuses on the manipulation of symbols and symbolic expressions.           | Lisp, Mathematica               |
| Meta Programming              | Writing programs that write or manipulate other programs.                  | Template Metaprogramming in C++ |

Please note that this categorization is not strict; many programming languages
support multiple paradigms, allowing developers to choose the best paradigm for
their specific task.

## Assoicatd graphics accelerators

Creating a comprehensive and up-to-date table of all GeForce models currently
available in the market is quite extensive due to the large variety of models
and frequent updates. However, I can provide a generalized overview of some of
the key series and models within NVIDIA's GeForce lineup, including some of the
most popular and recent releases. For the most current and detailed
information, it's best to consult NVIDIA's website or a reliable tech news
outlet.

Here's a simplified overview:

| Series                                 | Models                                                                                          |

| GeForce RTX 4000 Series (if available) | _Dependent on release and availability_                                                         |

Please note that this table is not exhaustive and does not include every single
model, especially the numerous custom variants offered by different
manufacturers. Also, the availability of these models can vary based on the
region and the current market situation. For the latest models and specific
details, checking the official NVIDIA website or a reputable computer hardware
retailer is recommended.
