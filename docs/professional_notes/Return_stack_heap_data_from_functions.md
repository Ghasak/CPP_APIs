## Logging and Updates

- The missing element in this note is the return of a pointer from a method
  within a class/struct. This will be elaborated on in a separate section ("/docs/classes_And_Structs/classes_with_RVO.md" for further details).

## My Understanding

### What I found

The following idea can revolutionize my way of thing of `C++` which is never was
possible without understand a bit more about the `C` language. Speaking on how
the `function/method` works in general.

        +--------------------------------------------------------------------+

```

#### Returning by value

1. Returning by value is a common and encouraged practice in C++ for many types
   of objects, especially those of trivial or moderate size. Modern C++
   compliers often optimize return by value usign copy elision and move
   semantics, reducing the overhead of copying.

2. When a function returns by value, it indeed returns a copy of its local
   object. However, with move semantics introduction in C++11, if the returned
   object is a termporary (rvalue), it can be moved rather than copied, which is
   more efficient.

3. The caller receives a copy (or a moved instance) of the returned value, which
   is then owned by the caller.

4. It is crusial that the return type of the function matches the type of the
   returned value. However, implicit conversions may occur if they are defined
   (e.g., returning a derived class object by value where the function's return
   type is a base class).
5. Returning by value is suitable for objects that can be efficiently moved or
   for return values that are primitive data types (e.g., int, double).

6. Examples include returning instance of STL containers (like `std::vector`,
   `std::string`) which support move semantics.

#### Returning by Pointer/Reference

1. Returning a pointer or reference to local scope data is highly discouraged
   and often incorrect because local objects are destroyed when the function
   scope exists. leaving dangling pointers or references.

2. Returning pointers or references is suitable when referring to objects with
   static storage duration, objects allocated on the heap, or members of objects
   whose lifetime exceeds that of the function call.

- Static local variables: A function can return a pointer or reference to a
  static local variable. These objects have a lifetime of the entire program
  execution, and thus their references or pointers remain valid after the
  function returns.

3. Heap-allocated objects: Returning a pointer (or a smart pointer like
   std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr) to an object allocated on the heap is
   valid. The caller becomes responsible for managing the lifetime of this
   object, especially if a raw pointer is used. Smart pointers are preferred to
   automate lifetime management.

4. Not Allowed for Stack-allocated non-static objects: Returning a pointer or
   reference to a non-static local variable (stack-allocated) is incorrect as
   the object's lifetime ends when the function scope is exited, leading to
   undefined behavior.

5. std::array and std::tuple Exception: You cannot safely return a pointer or
   reference to a local std::array or std::tuple from a function because these
   objects have automatic storage duration (stack-allocated) unless they are
   declared static within the function. These data container can return by value.

#### General Notes

- Static storage data: Use static storage duration objects judiciously as they
  remain in memory for the lifetime of the program and can lead to higher memory
  usage if overused.

- Choosing between Pointer/Reference and Value: The decision to return by
  pointer, reference, or value depends on the use case, performance
  considerations, and ownership semantics. Returning by value is preferred for
  simplicity and safety in many cases, especially with support for move
  semantics in C++11 and later.

- When returning references or pointers, consider the object's lifetime and who
  owns the object to avoid memory leaks and dangling references.

#### What can be considered Pointer or Reference

Here examples, highlight several scenarios where a type can be considered as or
decay to a pointer, as well as the general concept of references. Let's organize
this information into a clearer table format, correcting and expanding where
necessary:

| **Data Type/Scenario**                                    | **Description/Behavior**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C-Style Array**                                         | Decays to a pointer to its first element when passed to a function. For example, `int arr[10];` decays to `int*` when used as a function argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Character Pointer (`char*`)**                           | A pointer to a character. Often used for C-style strings, which are arrays of characters terminated by a null character (`'\0'`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Multidimensional Array (2D, 3D, etc.)**                 | Decays to a pointer to its first element (which itself may be an array). For example, `int mat[10][10];` can decay to `int (*)[10]`, a pointer to an array of 10 `int`s. A 3D array can decay similarly, with each level of decay reflecting the array's dimensions.                                                                                                       |
| **Pointers to Class/Struct Instances**                    | Can point to objects either on the stack or heap. For stack objects: `Entity obj; Entity* ptr = &obj;`. For heap objects: `Entity* obj = new Entity();`. It's crucial to manage the lifetime and ownership of heap-allocated objects to avoid memory leaks.                                                                                                                |
| **Function Pointers**                                     | Points to functions. Can be used to pass functions as arguments, store them in arrays, etc. For example, `void (*funcPtr)() = &myFunction;` points to a function `myFunction` that returns void and takes no arguments.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Smart Pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`)** | Modern C++ types that manage dynamic memory automatically. `std::unique_ptr<Entity>` is a smart pointer that owns an Entity object on the heap exclusively, while `std::shared_ptr<Entity>` allows multiple smart pointers to share ownership of an object.                                                                                                                |
| **References (`Type&`)**                                  | An alias for another object. Does not decay but behaves as an alternative name for the object it references. Can be used almost interchangeably with the object itself, except it cannot be null and cannot be made to reference a different object after its initialization. References are not pointers themselves but are often implemented under the hood as pointers. |

This table corrects and expands upon your initial points, providing a structured
overview of data types and scenarios involving pointers and references in C++.
It's important to note that while references act similarly to pointers in some
respects (such as referring to another object's memory), they are syntactically
and semantically different in C++: references are meant to be safer and more
intuitive than pointers, as they cannot be null and do not need to be
dereferenced explicitly.

#### Additionally, what else can be considered as a pointer or reference

To expand on the initial table and cover additional C++ concepts related to
pointers, references, and their behaviors, let's include more scenarios and data
types that involve or behave similarly to pointers and references:

| **Data Type/Scenario**                           | **Description/Behavior**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`void*` Pointers**                             | A generic pointer type that can hold the address of any object. `void*` pointers cannot be dereferenced without casting to another pointer type because they do not know the type of the object they point to.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Member Function Pointers**                     | Points to a member function of a class. Syntax and usage are more complex than function pointers. For example, `void (Entity::*funcPtr)() = &Entity::methodName;` points to a member function of `Entity`.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **`std::weak_ptr`**                              | A smart pointer that holds a non-owning ("weak") reference to an object that is managed by `std::shared_ptr`. It is used to break circular references between `std::shared_ptr` instances.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **`std::function`**                              | A wrapper for callable objects, functions, lambda expressions, bind expressions, or other function objects. It can store and invoke any callable target. `std::function<int(int, int)>` can represent a function that takes two `int` parameters and returns an `int`.                                                                                                        |
| **R-value References (`Type&&`)**                | Introduced in C++11 to support move semantics and perfect forwarding. They bind to temporary objects (r-values), allowing the efficient transfer of resources from temporaries to other objects.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Dynamic Arrays (`std::vector`, `std::array`)** | While not pointers themselves, these container classes manage dynamic arrays behind the scenes. `std::vector` manages its storage automatically and can resize, while `std::array` has fixed size. Accessing elements or getting a raw pointer to the data often involves pointer-like syntax (e.g., `&vector[0]` or `vector.data()` for a raw pointer to the first element). |
| **Iterators**                                    | While conceptually different from pointers, iterators in C++ often behave like pointers, especially iterators of standard library containers like `std::vector`, `std::list`, etc. They support operations like dereferencing (`*it`) and increment (`++it`), similar to pointer arithmetic.                                                                                  |
| **`const` Pointers and References**              | Pointers and references can be qualified with `const` to denote they point to const objects. For pointers, this can be `const Type*` (pointer to const) or `Type* const` (const pointer). For references, a `const Type&` is a reference to a const object, ensuring the referenced object cannot be modified through the reference.                                          |

These additions provide a more comprehensive view of the scenarios and data
types in C++ that involve or behave like pointers and references, highlighting
the language's flexibility in managing memory, function calls, and object
lifetimes. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective C++
programming, especially in contexts requiring dynamic memory management,
polymorphism, and resource optimization.

#### **Revised Rule of Thumb:**

- **Avoid returning pointers or references to local (stack-allocated)
  variables** from a function, as these variables will be destroyed when the
  function exits, leaving dangling pointers or invalid references.

- **Returning pointers or references is safe and appropriate in the following cases**:

  - **Heap-Allocated Objects**: If the function dynamically allocates an object
    on the heap (using `new` or similar mechanisms), returning a pointer (or a
    smart pointer) to this object is valid. The caller becomes responsible for
    managing the object's lifetime, ideally using smart pointers
    (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) to automate memory management and
    avoid leaks.

  - **Static or Global Variables**: Returning a pointer or reference to static
    or global variables is safe because their lifetime extends over the entire
    runtime of the program. However, use this approach judiciously to avoid
    unintended side effects or dependencies on global state.

  - **Existing Objects Passed to the Function**: Returning a pointer or
    reference to objects that were passed into the function (either directly or
    indirectly) is also safe, assuming the lifetime of the passed objects
    extends beyond the use of the pointer or reference.

- **Use Smart Pointers for Ownership and Lifetime Management**: When returning
  dynamically allocated objects from a function, prefer smart pointers
  (`std::unique_ptr` for unique ownership, `std::shared_ptr` for shared
  ownership) over raw pointers. Smart pointers automate memory management,
  making your code safer and easier to maintain.

- **Explicitly Document Ownership and Lifetime Expectations**: When a function
  returns a pointer or reference, clearly document who is responsible for
  managing the object's lifetime and how the object should be used. This helps
  prevent memory leaks and undefined behavior.

**Summary**:

The key is to ensure that any pointer or reference returned by a function
remains valid after the function exits and that the ownership and lifetime
expectations are clear and managed correctly. By adhering to these refined
guidelines, you can safely use pointers and references in your C++ programs
without risking undefined behavior, memory leaks, or other common pitfalls.

### Further Explanation

The following points cover important considerations for returning data from functions in
C++ but need some clarifications and corrections for accuracy and completeness.
Here's a revised and expanded list:

1. **Rules for Returning Data**:

   - Both C-style and Modern C++ have guidelines for returning data from
     functions, emphasizing safety, efficiency, and clarity in code design.

2. **Returning Local Variables**:

   - You should not return a local variable by reference or pointer from a
     function because it will be deallocated once it goes out of scope. This
     applies to data allocated on the stack.

3. **Returning Heap-Allocated Data**:

   - It is acceptable to return a reference or a pointer to data allocated on
     the heap, but the caller must manage the memory, ensuring it is freed
     appropriately to avoid memory leaks. In modern C++, using smart pointers
     (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) is recommended to automatically
     manage heap memory.

4. **Memory-Managed Containers**:

   - Returning a reference or a pointer to memory-managed data types/containers
     (e.g., `std::string`, `std::vector`) is generally safe because these
     containers manage their own memory. However, ensure the lifetime of the
     container extends beyond the use of the reference or pointer.

5. **Static Data**:

   - It is safe to return a reference or a pointer to static data since static
     variables live for the duration of the program, which guarantees their
     validity beyond the scope of the creating function.

6. **Returning `*this`**:

   - Returning `*this` from a method can act as a reference or a value based on
     the method signature. Returning `*this` by value is rare and typically used
     for implementing copy/move operations. More commonly, `*this` is returned
     by reference to allow method chaining on the same object. Check the `RVO` docs.

7. **Corrections and Additions**:

   - **`std::array` and `std::tuple`**: You mentioned returning a reference or a
     pointer for `std::array` and `std::tuple` and noted concerns about stack
     overflow. It's important to clarify that while `std::array` and
     `std::tuple` are indeed stack-allocated when defined as local variables,
     returning them by value is efficient and safe due to Return Value
     Optimization (RVO). Returning them by reference or pointer should only be
     done when they are static or have a longer lifetime than the function
     scope. Stack overflow concerns are generally unrelated to returning these
     objects but could occur with overly large stack-allocated objects.

   - **Modern C++ and Stack Overflow**: Modern C++ encourages using standard
     containers like `std::vector` instead of raw arrays for dynamic collections,
     reducing the risks associated with manual memory management and stack overflow
     from large stack-allocated arrays.

In summary, when designing functions in C++, it's crucial to consider the
lifetime and ownership of returned data, prefer standard library containers and
smart pointers for dynamic data, and ensure returned references or pointers
point to data with a guaranteed lifetime to avoid dangling references or memory
leaks.

## Examples

Certainly! Below are examples of C++ functions that demonstrate returning
various types of data. Each function is a simple example intended to illustrate
the specific type being returned.

### 1. Returning an Integer

```cpp
int getNumber() {
    return 42; // Returns an integer value
}
```

### 2. Returning a `std::string`

```cpp
#include <string>

std::string getMessage() {
    return "Hello, World!"; // Returns a std::string
}
```

### 3. Returning a C-Style Array

Returning a C-style array directly from a function is tricky because you can't
return an array by value in C++. However, you can return a pointer to a static
array (not recommended for serious applications due to lifetime and scope
issues) or dynamically allocated array (remember to deal with memory
management).

```cpp
const char* getDaysOfWeek() {
    static const char* days[] = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"};
    return *days; // Returns a pointer to the first element of a static array of C-style string
}
```

### 4. Returning a Char Array

Similar to returning a C-style array, returning a char array directly is not
straightforward due to the same reasons. A function can return a pointer to a
static or dynamically allocated char array.

```cpp
char* getAlphabet() {
    static char alphabet[] = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
    return alphabet; // Returns a pointer to a static char array
}
```

### 5. Returning a `std::vector`

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> getFibonacci(int n) {
    std::vector<int> fib = {0, 1};
    for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        fib.push_back(fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]);
    }
    return fib; // Returns a std::vector of integers
}
```

**Important Notes:**

- For the C-style array and char array examples, remember that returning
  pointers to local non-static arrays is dangerous because they go out of scope
  once the function exits.
- The static array or static char array approach is limited and generally not
  recommended for returning arrays from functions due to potential issues with
  data integrity in a multithreaded context or reentrancy issues.
- For more complex or larger data, consider using STL containers like
  `std::vector`, `std::array`, or smart pointers to manage dynamic memory
  safely.

## Example -2 About Array

In C++, you cannot return a C-style array by value directly from a function.
This limitation is because the array decays to a pointer when passed to or
returned from a function. Therefore, what you actually return when you try to
return a C-style array is a pointer to the first element of the array.

However, there are some important considerations and limitations:

1. **Local Non-Static Arrays:** If the array is local to the function (i.e., it
   is created inside the function), returning a pointer to it is unsafe. Once
   the function exits, the local array goes out of scope, and its memory can be
   overwritten by other parts of the program. Accessing this memory afterwards
   through the returned pointer leads to undefined behavior.

2. **Static Arrays:** If the array is declared as `static` within the function,
   then it is stored in the static storage area, not the stack, and its lifetime
   extends across the entire run of the program. In this case, you can return a
   pointer to the array, and it will still be valid outside the function.
   However, this approach has its own drawbacks, including potential issues with
   thread safety and the inability to return different arrays across different
   calls.

3. **Dynamically Allocated Arrays:** You can dynamically allocate an array on
   the heap using `new` (or `malloc` in C style), and return a pointer to this
   array. This way, the array remains valid until it is explicitly deleted
   (using `delete[]` for C++ or `free()` for C style). While this approach
   allows for flexible memory management and returning different arrays across
   calls, it introduces the need for careful memory management to avoid memory
   leaks.

Here's a quick illustration of each case:

- **Unsafe Return (Local Non-Static Array):**

  ```cpp
  int* getArray() {
      int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Local array, goes out of scope after function exit.
      return arr; // Warning: returning address of local variable
  }
  ```

- **Safe Return (Static Array):**

  ```cpp
  int* getStaticArray() {
      static int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Static array, remains valid.
      return arr; // OK: arr has static storage duration
  }
  ```

- **Dynamic Allocation (Heap Array):**
  ```cpp
  int* getDynamicArray() {
      int* arr = new int[5]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Dynamically allocated array, remains valid until deleted.
      return arr; // OK: pointer to heap memory
  }
  ```

In summary, while you can return a "C-style array" from a function in C++, what
you're actually returning is a pointer, and the method to do so safely involves
either using static arrays (with caution) or dynamically allocated memory (with
proper memory management).

- some examples that I created before:

```cpp
int My_function_retur_int() {
    int x = 10;
    return x;
}

std::string My_function_return_string() {
    std::string my_string = std::string("This is just a string on heap");
    return my_string;
}

```

## Q1: Returning a local variable from a function or method

Returning a data from a function of a local variable to the function/method consists of three paradiamgs:

- Return as a value.
- Return as a pointer.
- Return as a reference.

Therefore, let us examine this scenario:

```cpp

int* CreateArray(){
    int array[50];
    return array;
}

```

### Answer - Q1

- Here, we try to create a local array `on-stack` and return it (array means a
  pointer for C-Style array refer to first value).
- The code snippet you've provided contains several issues and misconceptions
  about handling arrays in C++. Let's address these issues one by one:

#### Issue with `CreateArray` Function

The `CreateArray` function attempts to return a pointer to a local array `array`
that is allocated on the stack. This is problematic because the array will be
destroyed once the function exits, leaving the returned pointer dangling.
Accessing the memory through this pointer will result in undefined behavior.

#### Correct Approach

If you want to return an array from a function and use it in `main()`, consider
the following correct approaches:

- **Dynamic Allocation**: Allocate the array on the heap and return a pointer
  (but remember to `delete[]` it to avoid memory leaks).
- **Use `std::vector` or `std::array`**: These are much safer and more flexible
  options in C++.

Here's how you can correctly use a dynamically allocated array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int* CreateArray() {
    int* array = new int[5]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    return array;
}

int main() {
    int* my_array = CreateArray();
    int size = 5; // You need to manage size separately
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        std::cout << "Return an array from a stack -> " << my_array[i] << std::endl;
    }
    delete[] my_array; // Don't forget to free the memory
    return 0;
}
```

If you decide to use `std::vector`, it simplifies memory management and size handling:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> CreateVector() {
    return std::vector<int>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> my_vector = CreateVector();
    for (int i = 0; i < my_vector.size(); i++) {
        std::cout << "Return an array from a stack -> " << my_vector[i] << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

These approaches are much safer and idiomatic in C++.

## Q2: Related to Q1, can we achieve such thing alternatively?

Returning a local array defined on the stack from a function in C++ as you've
shown is not safe. The reason is that local variables, including arrays, are
allocated on the stack, and their lifetime is limited to the scope of the
function. Once the function returns, the stack frame is popped, and the memory
area where `my_array` was stored is considered free. Accessing this memory
afterwards results in undefined behavior because it may be overwritten by other
stack operations.

However, if you want to return an array from a function, there are several safer
alternatives:

### 1. Dynamic Allocation - We have saw that (see above)

You can dynamically allocate an array on the heap and return a pointer to it.
Remember, this approach requires you to manage the memory manually and ensure
that it is properly deleted when no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.

```cpp
int* myArrayFunction() {
    int* my_array = new int[5];
    // Initialize array or perform operations
    return my_array;
}
```

Caller must remember to `delete[]` the array when done:

```cpp
int* arr = myArrayFunction();
// Use arr
delete[] arr;
```

### 2. Returning by Value Using Containers

A more modern and safer approach is to use STL containers like `std::vector`,
which manages memory automatically and can be returned by value efficiently
thanks to Return Value Optimization (RVO) and move semantics introduced in
C++11.

```cpp
std::vector<int> myArrayFunction() {
    std::vector<int> my_array(5);
    // Initialize vector or perform operations
    return my_array;
}
```

### 3. Static Allocation

If the size of the array is fixed and known at compile time, and if the array is
not too large, you might opt for static allocation with `static` storage
duration, though this approach has limitations and is generally not recommended
for returning data from functions due to the shared state.

```cpp
int* myArrayFunction() {
    static int my_array[5];
    // Initialize array or perform operations
    return my_array;
}
```

This makes `my_array` persist beyond the function call, but the same array will
be shared across all calls to the function, which is rarely what you want and
can lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption in a multithreaded context.

### 4. Using std::array or std::tuple (for Fixed Size Arrays)

For small, fixed-size arrays, `std::array` (C++11 and later) provides a
stack-allocated, fixed-size array that can be returned by value, avoiding the
undefined behavior of returning a pointer to a local array.

```cpp
#include <array>

std::array<int, 5> myArrayFunction() {
    std::array<int, 5> my_array{};
    // Initialize array or perform operations
    return my_array;
}
```

### Conclusion

Prefer using `std::vector` or `std::array` for most cases where you need to
return a collection of elements from a function. These containers manage memory
for you, make your code safer, more modern, and less prone to errors.

## Q3 - Rules For Return a value from a function/method

Returning values from functions in C++ can be done in various ways, each with
its considerations and best practices. These include returning by value, by
pointer, and by reference. Additionally, understanding the implications of
returning objects located on the stack versus the heap is crucial. Here's a
comprehensive look at the rules and considerations for each method, covering
both C-style and modern C++ practices.

### 1. Returning by Value

- **Stack**: Typically used for returning local variables or objects. The
  returned object is copied or moved from the function scope to the caller.
  Modern C++ optimizes this operation through Return Value Optimization (RVO)
  and move semantics, minimizing performance overhead.
- **Heap**: Not directly applicable, as you don't return heap-allocated memory
  by value, but rather by pointer or reference to avoid memory leaks.
- **Considerations**: Suitable for returning small to moderately sized objects.
  Always consider the cost of copying and the availability of move semantics.
  For large objects, returning by pointer or reference might be more efficient.

### 2. Returning by Pointer

- **Stack**: Returning pointers to local stack-allocated variables is unsafe
  because the stack memory is reclaimed once the function exits, leaving a
  dangling pointer.
- **Heap**: Suitable for returning objects allocated on the heap (`new`). The
  caller is responsible for managing the memory (using `delete` or `delete[]`).
- **Considerations**: Returning raw pointers requires careful memory management
  to avoid leaks. Prefer smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`)
  in modern C++ for automatic memory management.

### 3. Returning by Reference

- **Stack**: Like pointers, returning references to local stack-allocated
  variables is unsafe for the same reason—it results in a reference to memory
  that is no longer valid after the function exits.
- **Heap**: Not commonly used. Heap memory is typically managed through
  pointers, especially smart pointers in modern C++.
- **Considerations**: Suitable for returning objects that are guaranteed to
  outlive the call to the function, such as class members or global/static
  variables. Be cautious of the lifetime of the referenced object to avoid
  dangling references.

### 4. Returning C-Style Arrays

- **Stack**: Directly returning a C-style array allocated on the stack is not
  possible, as functions cannot return array types. Returning a pointer to a
  local array leads to undefined behavior.
- **Heap**: You can return a pointer to a dynamically allocated array, but this
  requires manual memory management by the caller.
- **Considerations**: In modern C++, prefer returning a `std::array` (for
  fixed-size arrays) or `std::vector` (for dynamic arrays) by value, leveraging
  RVO and move semantics for efficiency.

### 5. Modern C++ Alternatives

- **Smart Pointers**: Use `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership and
  `std::shared_ptr` for shared ownership. These manage heap-allocated memory
  automatically, avoiding memory leaks.
- **Standard Containers**: `std::vector`, `std::array`, `std::list`, etc., can
  be returned by value efficiently due to RVO and move semantics. They are safer
  and more flexible than raw pointers or C-style arrays.
- **std::optional and std::variant**: For returning values that might be "empty"
  or one of several types, respectively. These types provide safer, more
  expressive alternatives to returning raw pointers or special sentinel values.

### General Considerations

- **Performance**: Always consider the cost of copying large objects and prefer
  move semantics when applicable.
- **Safety**: Avoid returning pointers or references to local stack variables.
- **Lifetime Management**: Ensure the lifetime of returned references or
  pointed-to objects is well managed to prevent dangling pointers or references.
- **Modern C++ Practices**: Favor standard library features and smart pointers
  to manage memory safely and efficiently.

By following these guidelines and understanding the implications of each return
type, you can write safer, more efficient C++ code that makes the best use of
both stack and heap memory.

Here's a table summarizing the rules for returning values from functions in C++:

| **Return Type**    | **Example**                                                        | **Location** | **Memory Management** | **C++ Style**  | **Considerations**                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | --------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Value              | `int func() { return 5; }`                                         | Stack        | Automatic             | Modern/C-Style | Prefer for simple and small-sized data. RVO and move semantics minimize copy overhead.                                                               |
| Pointer            | `int* func() { return new int(5); }`                               | Heap         | Manual                | C-Style        | Caller must manage memory (`delete`). Prefer smart pointers in modern C++.                                                                           |
| Reference          | `int& func() { static int x = 5; return x; }`                      | Stack/Heap   | Automatic             | Modern/C-Style | Only return references to objects with a lifetime longer than the function execution. Avoid returning references to local stack-allocated variables. |
| Smart Pointer      | `std::unique_ptr<int> func() { return std::make_unique<int>(5); }` | Heap         | Automatic             | Modern         | Encapsulates memory management. `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership, `std::shared_ptr` for shared.                                             |
| Standard Container | `std::vector<int> func() { return {1, 2, 3}; }`                    | Stack        | Automatic             | Modern         | Use for dynamic arrays. RVO and move semantics make return by value efficient.                                                                       |
| `std::array`       | `std::array<int, 3> func() { return {1, 2, 3}; }`                  | Stack        | Automatic             | Modern         | Fixed-size array. Prefer over C-style arrays for return by value.                                                                                    |
| `std::optional`    | `std::optional<int> func() { return 5; }`                          | Stack        | Automatic             | Modern         | For functions that may not return a value. Provides a safer alternative to returning null pointers or special values.                                |
| `std::variant`     | `std::variant<int, std::string> func() { return 5; }`              | Stack        | Automatic             | Modern         | For functions that may return one of several types. Provides type-safe unions.                                                                       |

### Key Considerations:

- **Stack vs. Heap**: Objects returned by value are usually created on the
  stack, while objects returned by pointer or smart pointer are allocated on the
  heap.
- **Memory Management**: Automatic memory management is provided for
  stack-allocated variables, standard containers, and smart pointers. Manual
  memory management is required when returning raw pointers to heap-allocated
  memory.
- **Modern C++ Style**: Modern C++ favors return by value for most cases due to
  compiler optimizations like RVO, and smart pointers or standard containers for
  resource management to avoid manual memory management and reduce the risk of
  memory leaks.
- **Lifetime and Safety**: Ensure the lifetime of returned objects is managed
  correctly to avoid dangling pointers or references. Avoid returning pointers
  or references to local stack variables, as they become invalid once the
  function returns.

This table provides a broad overview, but each project's specific requirements
and constraints should guide the choice of return type.
